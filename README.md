## About this repo
This is the visualisation part of the Speech Explorer Project (SEP). The goal of this application is to provide an easy to use tool for visualization and exploration of sound data. The data can be generated using the data crunching part of the SEP which can is found [here](https://github.com/SSGL-SEP/t-sne_cruncher).

## Implementation
The app itself is made using JavaScript and Node.js. Visualization is implemented using 3D library called three.js and WebGL. UI is created using modified [dat.gui](https://github.com/SSGL-SEP/dat.gui).
