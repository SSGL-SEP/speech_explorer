In-app info box opens up by clicking the blue “i” -icon in the top left area.

### Hotkeys:

- S: start/stop selecting
- R: start/stop removing
- D: download .wav for active point (clicked on by left mouse button)


Mouse over a point to listen to the sound file associated with it. Information about the point is shown in the top right corner.

Pan around with left mouse button held down. Zoom in and out with mouse wheel.

You can click on a point to open an information panel in the lower right corner that does not disappear after moving to another point.

Filtering is possible in the control panel. You can change individual filters by opening folders and clicking on the checkbox or you can disable/enable all checkboxes within a folder by clicking the corresponding icons next to the folder name. It’s also possible to enable/disable all filters at the same time from the bottom of the filter section.

The Filter selections create a union (OR) inside each individual tag folder and an intersection (AND) between tag groups. This means that each tag folder must have at least one value enabled in the filter for any tags to be active. Inactive tags can’t be interacted with.

Filters can be saved as presets from the top left corner. It’s possible to quickly switch between saved filters by clicking on the dropdown and then using the up and down arrow key. Filters can be deleted and they will be cleared if you switch to a totally different dataset. Switching to a same dataset with different analyzation method will not clear the saved filters.

It’s possible to change the coloring of the point cloud from a dropdown menu in the control panel. Each tag has a color specified to it during the analyzation process and you may freely switch in between of these.

Selection mode can be entered by pressing ‘s’, you can leave selection mode by pressing ‘s’ again. In selection mode you can paint over points. All selected sounds can be downloaded, played back to back, playback can be stopped and all points can be deselected from the top center panel that opens up when the selection mode is enabled.

Removing mode can be entered by pressing ‘r’, you can leave it by pressing ‘r’ again. Painting over selected points removes them from selection.

You can also remove individual points from selection by selecting it with left click and clicking deselect in the bottom right panel.

Changing filter settings clears all selected points.
